This is a fork of the Sparkle Kodi plugin that can be used to find acestream links from the Soccerstreams subreddit. Note that you need Acestream and Plexus installed in Kodi to use it. See releases section for these.

Simply download the ZIP folders to the Kodi device, then install from Addons -> Install from zip file

This version is purely for acestream links posted in /r/soccerstreams.

This addon does not provide any content whatsoever, it is merely a method of scraping acestream links into Kodi to save copy/pasting them into Plexus.

For Raspberry Pi, an updated version of Acestream can be installed. Connect to the Pi over SSH then:

```
cd ~/.kodi/userdata/addon_data/program.plexus

sudo rm -r acestream

wget https://github.com/jackyaz/plugin.video.sparkle/releases/download/1.1.0/acestream3121.tar.gz

tar xfv acestream3121.tar.gz
```
