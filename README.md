This addon does not provide any content whatsoever, it is merely enabling the listing of acestream links in Kodi.  Please ensure that you are only using legitimate, legal Acestreams. Use of Acestream for illegally streamed sources is not supported by this project.

This is a fork of the Sparkle addon for Kodi. Note that you need Acestream and Plexus installed in Kodi to use it. These have been uploaded to Releases for this addon. These dependencies are provided as-is, and have been included from other sources for convenience.

Simply download the ZIP folders to the Kodi device, then install from Addons -> Install from zip file
